              The MeetInGround app handles and processes the personal
              information you've shared with us to facilitate our Service.
              Ensuring the security of your phone and access to the app falls
              under your responsibility. We strongly advise against jailbreaking
              or rooting your phone, a procedure that involves bypassing
              software restrictions set by the official operating system of your
              device. Engaging in such actions could render your phone
              susceptible to malware, viruses, or other security breaches. The
              app integrates with third-party services, each of which has its
              own set of Terms and Conditions.
